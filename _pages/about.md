<strong>I am interested in designing and building AI systems that promote mutual understanding and cooperation.</strong> 

My research in <strong class="highlights">Human-Computer Interaction</strong> lies at the intersection of <strong class="highlights">human-centered AI</strong>, <strong class="highlights">social computing</strong>, and <strong class="highlights">accessibility</strong>. Currently, I am collaborating with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/marycz/">Drs. Mary Czerwinski</a> & <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jinsuh/">Jina Suh</a> (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/human-understanding-and-empathy/">Microsoft Research</a>) to design empathic human-AI interactions. I am also working with <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/elaine-short">Prof. Elaine Short</a> (<a href="https://aabl.cs.tufts.edu/">Tufts</a>) to develop assistive robot algorithms that support human agency and creativity. 

My research has sparked the following questions: What harms occur when algorithms make predictive judgments about user behavior? How can we build interactive systems that have the flexibility and robustness to support human variability? 

I am fortunate to be supported by the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships">NSF CSGrad4US Fellowship</a> for three fully funded years in a CISE PhD program. Through my research, I hope to make sustainable progress toward a more compassionate and equitable society. 

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Brown University. In my day job, I develop distributed systems infrastructure for Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Previously, I built assistive technology on Windows for vision, mobility, cognitive, and mental health disabilities.
