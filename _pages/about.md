Hi! I'm Lindy, a first-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan. My research is in <strong> human-AI interaction </strong>: I am interested in designing and building AI systems that support <strong>human connection</strong>, <strong>relationality</strong>, and <strong>socio-emotional well-being.</strong> In doing so, I hope to make sustainable progress toward a more compassionate society. I am fortunate to be supported by the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships">NSF CSGrad4US Fellowship</a>. 

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Brown University. Previously, I worked in industry for 7 years at Microsoft, where I collaborated with Microsoft Research's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/human-understanding-and-empathy/">Human Understanding and Empathy (HUE)</a> lab, developed distributed systems infrastructure for Azure, and built assistive technology on Windows. You can find more information in my <a href="../assets/pdf/Lindy_Le_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
