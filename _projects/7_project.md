## Project Overview
People with limited mobility can struggle to use a traditional keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. <a href="https://www.perkins.org/resource/introduction-7-common-adaptive-switches/" target="_blank">Assistive switches</a> are a class of peripheral devices that allow people with limited mobility to navigate and interact with their computing device. Switch Access was a new assistive technology solution for people with limited mobility to operate Windows.

## Approach
Similar to <a href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/focus-keyboard-operability" target="_blank">other assistive technology such as screen readers</a>, Switch Access had a focus indicator that showed which element on the screen will be acted upon. A menu showed available actions that users can perform on the focused element. Limited mobility users controlled the focus indicator and menu via a switch device with two assistive switches.

## My Role
I drove the project strategy and execution, leading a cross-functional team of 14 members across Redmond and India. I developed and established consensus on a 3-year roadmap of 44 prioritized user scenarios and coordinated semimonthly collaborations with 17 external customers. I also led end-to-end product development for 7 features, which involved conducting market and user research; defining product specifications and requirements; and working cross-functionally to design, develop, and test product changes.

## Outcomes
Switch Access enabled limited mobility users to navigate and interact with Windows, to meet compliance standards and unblock device sales for 856K people.
