## Project Overview
Internet distractions cause a loss in productivity that <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/conquering-digital-distraction" target="_blank">costs the U.S. economy over $997 billion annually</a>. Remote work due to the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1139757/us-distractions-while-working-from-home-during-coronavirus/" target="_blank">COVID-19 pandemic worsened this problem</a>. Grounded in the lived experiences of neurodivergent individuals, A Calmer Web is a digital sanctuary where users can focus, be productive, and achieve their goals.

## My Role
I developed the vision and roadmap for A Calmer Web, driving a partnership across Windows and Microsoft Edge. To iterate on and validate the design, I conducted 8 semi-structured interviews with neurodiverse users. I also produced the above pitch video to publicize the project and led subsequent investments in cognitive and mental health accessibility.

## Motivations
A Calmer Web was grounded in my experiences with undiagnosed autism and ADHD. While working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, I found it really hard to focus on the Internet. Websites were constantly overwhelming me with trending news, ads, and notifications. Certain stimuli were directly harmful, triggering my Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) and leaving me in an immobilized state of panic. I reached out to other Microsoft employees from the Neurodiverse ERG and discovered that I was not alone in these experiences, which inspired me to build and deploy A Calmer Web.

## Approach
A Calmer Web was implemented as a Microsoft Edge browser extension that helps users focus through digital affordances based on ADHD management tools. It integrated with the Focus Timer and Microsoft To-Do applications to facilitate <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/03/03/the-pomodoro-technique/?sh=21a5e00a3985" target="_blank">Pomodoro sessions</a> and offer machine learning&ndash;based recommendations based on users' current task.

## Outcomes
A Calmer Web received enthusiastic support from Windows leadership. I leveraged the success of the project to drive new productivity solutions for neurodivergent users, including the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-use-focus-on-windows-11-2022-update" target="_blank">Focus Sessions feature on Windows 11</a>, which was inspired by A Calmer Web.
