## Project Overview
Internet distractions cause a loss in productivity that <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/conquering-digital-distraction" target="_blank">costs the U.S. economy over $997 billion annually</a>. Remote work due to the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1139757/us-distractions-while-working-from-home-during-coronavirus/" target="_blank">COVID-19 pandemic worsened this problem</a>. Grounded in the lived experiences of neurodivergent individuals, A Calmer Web is a digital sanctuary where users can focus, be productive, and achieve their goals.

## Approach
A Calmer Web was implemented as a Microsoft Edge browser extension that helps users focus through digital affordances based on ADHD management tools. It integrated with the Focus Timer and Microsoft To-Do applications to facilitate <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/03/03/the-pomodoro-technique/?sh=21a5e00a3985" target="_blank">Pomodoro sessions</a> and offer machine learning&ndash;based recommendations based on users' current task.

## My Role
I created the project concept, designed the interactions, and drove the partnership between Windows and Microsoft Edge to build the application.

## Outcomes
A Calmer Web received enthusiastic support from Windows leadership. I leveraged the success of the project to drive new productivity solutions for neurodivergent users, including the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-use-focus-on-windows-11-2022-update" target="_blank">Focus Sessions feature on Windows 11</a>, which was inspired by A Calmer Web.
