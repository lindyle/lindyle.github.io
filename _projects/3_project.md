## Project Overview
Despite making up the majority of management ranks, line managers' decision-making needs remain understudied. Moreover, technological supports for social decision-making have focused on domains where decision makers do not have close relationships with those impacted by their decisions. 

## Approach
Through formative research, we identified managerial communication and analysis needs that existing tools did not adequately support. To accommodate reasoning over a range of intuitive and calculative decision-
making, we developed a technology probe that represents every decision as a multi-level value tree, which is generated using LLMs and connected to raw data in a spreadsheet.

## Outcomes
Our work discusses how the design of social decision-making supports, especially in the workplace, can more explicitly support highly interactional social decision-making {% cite 10.1145/3613904.3642685 %}.
